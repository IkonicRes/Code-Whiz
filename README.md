## Description

I wanted to have a fun little test of coding knowledge by making a short quiz game, with the option to get competetive with high scores and time-based stakes. This was a really
neat little project that ended up looking pretty nice. I wanted the user to have time deducted for making incorrect answers and the score to be based off how quickly you answered
the questions correctly. This project taught me a lot about using js to manipulate css and html in many different ways, and has kind of made me more comfortable with the idea of
applying my existing code knowledge to front-end development. It helps me remember some of the basics as well as track my progress getting better.

## Usage

Head on over here to check out the page ==> [Code Whiz](https://ikonicres.github.io/Code-Whiz/)    
The page is easy to use: When the "View High Scores" button is clicked, it will navigate the user to the high score page. When "Start Quiz" is pressed, the timer will start and progress bar will start counting down and all questions and answers will populate.

As stated in the text above the button, the quiz is timed, and incorrect answers will subtract fifteen seconds from your time. !  
To add a screenshot, create an `assets/images` folder in your repository and upload your screenshot to it. Then, using the relative filepath, add it to your README using the following syntax:

```md
![alt text](assets/images/screenshot.png)
```
